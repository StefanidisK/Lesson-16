# Lesson 16: Lists
Write a program that creates a list of 100 random numbers between 0 and 100. It should print out the numbers. Then your program should find the average of the 100 numbers. 

Questions to ask yourself:

Do I know how to get a random number in Python?  How can I find out how to do that?
How many times do I need to go through the code? Should I use a while loop or a for loop?
